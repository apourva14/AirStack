## Apurva Singh — GPS Degradation Research (AirLab, CMU)

### What I worked on
Brief description of the satellite/GNSS degradation pipeline you built — 
LOS blockage, shadowing, multipath modeling, VIO evaluation under degraded GPS

### Branch
All my work lives in `apurva/satellite`

### Key contributions
- Designed simulator-side GPS degradation pipeline (healthy/degraded/denied/recovery regimes)
- Mapped VIO estimator requirements to AirStack ROS2/PX4 stack
- Integrated with Isaac Sim / AirStack for realistic navigation condition testing
AirStack is a comprehensive, modular autonomy stack for embodied AI and robotics developed by the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org) at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute. It provides a complete framework for developing, testing, and deploying autonomous mobile systems in both simulated and real-world environments.

## 🔧 Quick Start

Follow the instructions at https://docs.theairlab.org/main/docs/getting_started/ to set up AirStack on your machine.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

AirStack follows a layered architecture approach:

```
Robot
├── Interface Layer: Communication with robot controllers
├── Sensors Layer: Data acquisition from various sensors
├── Perception Layer: State estimation and environment understanding
├── Local Layer:
│   ├── World Model: Local environment representation
│   ├── Planning: Trajectory generation and obstacle avoidance
│   └── Controls: Trajectory following
├── Global Layer:
│   ├── World Model: Global environment mapping
│   └── Planning: Mission-level path planning
└── Behavior Layer: High-level decision making
```

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `robot/`: Contains the ROS 2 workspace for the robot autonomy stack
- `gcs/`: Software for monitoring and controlling robots
- `simulation/`: Integration with Isaac Sim and simulation environments
